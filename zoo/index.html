        <h2>Bears</h2>
        <p>Bears are large mammals that drink their mother's milk as babies and have fur. They also have a snout and short, stubby tails. The smallest 
            bears are sun bears and weigh about a hundred pounds, while polar bears are the largest and can weigh over 1,500 pounds! That's about the 
            same as three large male lions!</p>

        <!--This section describes alligators-->
        <h2>Alligators</h2>
        <p>These reptiles are kind of clumsy on land, but they're built for life in the water. Great swimmers, they are equipped with webbed feet and strong 
            tails that propel them through the water. An average male American alligator is 10 to 15 feet (three to five meters) long. Half of its length is 
            its massive, strong tail.</p>
